            <h3>Joseph Sidote</h3>
            <img src="images/profile.png" alt="" class="profile">
            <p>My name is Joseph Sidote, I am 17 years old and a student at Vinal Technical High School in the IT trade. I came to Vinal because I believed that getting a head start in the field that I want to be in for the rest of my life would be beneficial and better than my town school in almost every way imaginable. When I had to pick a trade I chose IT for a lot of reasons, however the two that made me pick it over my other options were how broad IT is as a whole, and that my family have been involved in the field for as long as I can remember. After looking into multiple different kinds of work I found I am most interested in CAD modeling, 3D printing, CNC, and planning to major in mechanical engineering in college.</p>
            <p>In academics I have always excelled, keeping honor and high honor rolls throughout all 4 years I have been through. I have consistently retained above a 4.0 weighted GPA through the years I have spent at Vinal and get every assignment I’m given turned in on time and with my full effort put in. I mainly focused on my time management skills to do this. When I was given an assignment I would use my time in class to finish it, and if I couldn’t I would take any opportunity during any free time I had throughout the day to finish. I have completed all five of my math courses independently so I could plan out my work in the most efficient and effective way for me. This led me to finishing all of the courses I needed to graduate in two years and I could use the last two for harder courses so that I am more prepared for college. </p>

            <p>For my shop I chose IT mainly for the two aforementioned reasons, and also how much the IT field is involved in the workforce right now. Firstly, I liked how broad the shop of IT is. It covers everything from coding and programming to cybersecurity and ethical hacking and I knew that I could find something enjoyable to study even if it wasn’t the first thing I picked up during freshman year. Secondly, I knew that if I needed help with anything I was doing I could go to my family as well as my teachers which I wouldn’t be able to do in any of the other shops. People like my parents have helped me all through the school year if I had personal projects I wanted to do at home and I had teachers I could show these projects to and get feedback to make them better. Finally, I knew there were hundreds of job opportunities in fields that I’m actually passionate about that I could look forward to after school. Every assignment in my shop that I received I completed to the best of my ability and took mental notes of what I enjoyed and what I didn't, which led me towards CAD modeling, engineering, and manufacturing. </p>
            <p>Throughout my life I have always liked to build things whether it was with legos as a kid or big projects like my homemade foundry that I made recently. Studying CAD and engineering in school did nothing but make me love that kind of stuff even more. The most satisfying thing for me is to have an issue that affects my life, think of a solution, and actually make the solution come to life instead of just thinking about how good it would be if it wasn’t a problem anymore. At Vinal, my shop teachers gave me everything they could to ensure that I had everything I needed to succeed and solve any problems that came up while I was working. I have 3D modeled and printed many things both at home and school that all make random things in my life easier or more convenient.</p>
            <p>This portfolio will show off my achievements, projects, certifications, skills, etc in depth. Everything will be explained in detail with photo and video examples and explanations. My goal after high school is to further my education in engineering, manufacturing, and CAD modeling. I’d also like to get a job in the field as soon as I possibly can to learn exactly what working in the field everyday is like so I can excel anywhere I go later in life. </p>
